<p>
My name is Michael J. Ayers, I graduated from Winslow High School in June 2017,
</br>and am now attending the University of Maine for business. I have lived in Maine
</br>my whole life, not venturing too far outside of the state usually, although I'd
</br>like to change that some day.
I had some complications when growing up,
</br>when I was around the age of one or two, I had open heart surgery,
</br>which thankfully went well. Along with that, I have / had a
</br>motor disorder called, Apraxia. It basically prevented
</br>my brain from processing simple movements
</br>which resulted in a hard time learning
</br>how to speak, but thankfullythrough
</br>a lot of speech therapy as a child, I
</br>would like to say that I have
</br>come a long way, and
</br>have conquerred a
</br>big portion of it.
</br>Thank you for
</br>visiting my
</br> website.
</br>-M.J.A
