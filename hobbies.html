<p> I buy & sell items, and have been since the age of, roughly eleven. It all started when I tagged along with my grandfather to a few garage sales where he hunted for items to sell himself. He told me we would split the profit of an item from that day, which resulted in a $50 profit for me, and at from moment, I have been hooked since. I mainly deal with video games, ranging from the original Nintendo (NES) right up to the newer stuff, as there is a pretty big market for them. So my Saturday mornings consist of hitting whatever garage sales we can find, and hope for the best.

I've also been bowling for quite a while, from a young kid doing a few fun leagues, learning the sport, to high school league, and competing in a stats competition, unfortunately not resulting in a win, but I did do fairly well. My average in high school flocculated, but typically was in the high hundreds, with my best score being around the 260 mark.
